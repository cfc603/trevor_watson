                        <p>While many computers introduced in the past few years have included the newer, faster type of hard drive called SSD, most continue to use the old type, HDD. For a deep dive on the difference between the two, check out this article from <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-vs-hdd.html" target="_blank">intel.com</a> The biggest takeaway is speed, 10 to 20 times of the older style.</p>
                        <p>If you are looking for a quick, cost effective way, upgrading your hard drive should definitely be considered.</p>

                        <p>Hard Drives are, generally speaking, a very robust, dependable part of your computer, but they do fail. I don't know about you, but my day to day work life depends on accessing the data on my laptop. If the data were to disappear, it would be catastrophic.</p>
                        <p>The best way to mitigate risk, is have some insurance! In this case, a local backup and cloud backup.</p>

                        <p>Don't go unprotected, be sure to have antivirus software on all your computers.</p>

                        <p>I LOVE virtual phone numbers, and I'm not sure why more businesses have not caught on to this. Here's the biggest use case, tracking advertisements.</p>
                        <p>My wife started her own lawn service on the side, she loves working outdoors. When she first started out, she tried a number of different advertising venues. Ironically, the cheapest advertising source gave her the largest ROI. In fact, something like 60% of her monthly revenue came from a $82 advertisement. At a fraction of her advertising budget, we were able to track this by having a virtual phone number for each advertising source.</p>

                        <p>Text messaging is the primary source of communication in todays society. Unfortunately businesses have been slow to adopt in their tools of communicating with their customers. One of the reasons for this is having enough staff to promptly reply to customer messages.</p>
                        <p>A chatbot can be a great way to offer messaging without the additional staffing overhead. By programming the chatbot bot to answer frequent scenarios, and even collect and remit data, you can reduce the load on your employees, while offering a convenient way for your customers to engage with your company.</p>

                        <p>I love my dentist office, not only because of the great work they do on keeping my smile healthy, but they send me a text reminding me of upcoming appointments.

                        <p>While a lot of <abbr title="Customer Relationship Manager">CRM's</abbr> are integrating text messaging into their software, not all on are on-board just yet. That's okay, we can certainly work around it.</p>
